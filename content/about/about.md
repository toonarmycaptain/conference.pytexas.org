## What is PyTexas?

PyTexas is the annual, regional gathering for the Python community in Texas.
PyTexas is organized and run by community volunteers. PyTexas, like most of the
Python community, is focused on providing a [diverse](/about/diversity-statement) and enjoyable experience
for everyone interested in Python. Please help us do that by following the
[code of conduct](/about/code-of-conduct).

## Volunteers

PyTexas is organized and run by volunteers from the Python community. We
generally assign tasks beginning the Thursday night before the conference and
going through the conclusion of the conference on Sunday. If you would like to
help, please send an e-mail to [volunteers@pytexas.org](mailto:volunteers@pytexas.org). We'll contact you as
conference time approaches.

## Contact Us

Please feel free to email [conference@pytexas.org](mailto:conference@pytexas.org) with any questions.

You may also reach the larger Texas Python community by joining the mailing
list, which is used for general community discussions. Python-oriented job
postings are also welcome on the list.
